               <h2 class="card-title">Animal kingdom</h2>
               <p class="card-text">Animals belong to the largest and most diverse of the five kingdoms of living things. So far <span class='text-red'>over two million animal species have been identified.</span> All animals share certain features. Unlike plants, animals get the energy they need by eating
                  food. They are all made up of many cells and many animals are highly mobile. Most reproduce sexually and have sense organs that allow them to react quickly to their surroundings. <span class='text-red'>Classification</span> uses these and other characteristics to
                  group similar animals together.</p>
            </div>

         <div class="card">

               <h2 class="card-title">Classification</h2>
               <p class="card-text">In order to make animals easier to study, scientists divide the animal kingdom into divisions and subdivisions. The first <span class='text-red'>division</span> is called a <span class='text-red'>phylum.</span> Each phylum breaks down into groups called <span class='text-red'>classes.</span> Classes are divided into <span class='text-red'>orders,</span>
                  then <span class='text-red'>families,</span> and then <span class='text-red'>genera.</span> Each genus contains <span class='text-red'>species,</span> which are individual groups of animals that have the same characteristics and can breed together.</p>
               <p class="card-text">Some animals, such as jellyfish, have a relatively simple structure. They have no skeleton, few muscles, and their movement is uncoordinated – they drift with ocean currents. Jellyfish are referred to as invertebrates because, like <span class='text-red'>98 per
                  cent of animals, they have no backbone.</span></p>
               <p class="card-text">Animals with backbones, like these zebras, are commonly referred to as vertebrates. Mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and reptiles are all vertebrates. Zebras belong to the mammal order. <span class='text-red'>Mammals,</span> which also include humans, <span class='text-red'>are the most
                  complex animals in the animal kingdom.</span></p>
               <p class="card-text">ossils indicate that animals have existed on Earth for over 1.2 billion years, but <span class='text-red'>our knowledge of past life is still incomplete.</span> Some prehistoric animals look very different from today’s animals. However, this ammonite looks similar to
                  the living sea animal nautilus. We can learn about past life by studying the similarities between fossils and living animals.</p>

               <h2 class="card-title">Why is it for us to protect species?</h2>
               <h4 class="card-subtitle">Ecological importance</h4>
               <p class="card-text">Healthy ecosystems depend on plant and animal species as their foundations. <span class='text-red'>When a species becomes endangered, it is a sign that the ecosystem is slowly falling apart.</span> Each species that is lost triggers the loss of other species within
                  its ecosystem. Humans depend on healthy ecosystems to purify our environment. Without healthy forests, grasslands, rivers, oceans and other ecosystems, we will not have clean air, water, or land. If we allow our environment to become
                  contaminated, <span class='text-red'>we risk our own health.</span></p>
               <h4 class="card-subtitle">Medical</h4>
               <p class="card-text">Over 50% of the 150 most prescribed medicines were originally derived from a plant or other natural product. Unfortunately, only about 5% of known plant species have been tested for medicinal uses and there are thousands of plant species
                  that have yet to be identified. Tens of thousands of Americans die every year from illnesses for which there is no known cure. The <span class='text-red'>cures for these diseases may eventually come from plants,</span> therefore, we must protect all species before
                  they are lost forever from nature’s medicine cabinet.</p>

               <h4 class="card-subtitle">Aesthetic/Recreational</h4>
               <p class="card-text">The American tourism industry is dependent on plant and animal species and their ecosystems for their multi-billion dollar, job-intensive industry. Every year, millions of people visit natural areas in the US and participate in wildlife
                  related activities. From woodland hikes to beach going, outdoor activities are the second most popular travel activity (Travel Industry Association of America). The U.S. Park Service logs over 200 million visitors to our National Parks
                  every year. The local economies of these areas benefit greatly from activities associated with these visits. <span class='text-red'>The preservation of our nation’s biological diversity is an immensely important facet to the survival of the travel industry.</span></p>

               <h4 class="card-subtitle">Agricultural</h4>
               <p class="card-text">Agriculture also plays an important role in the protection of species, farmers are often seen as the original conservationists. Many farmers set aside portions of their land as wildlife habitat and also work in partnership with groups such
                  as Trout Unlimited to restore river and stream habitats for endangered and threatened fish and reptiles. In addition, <span class='text-red'>wild relatives of common crops contain important genetic material needed to maintain these crops.</span> These relatives can
                  be used to ensure crops are disease-resistant while providing information for developing new crops that can grow in less than adequate lands.</p>

Helmeted hornbills stand apart from the other hornbills because
                     their casques are mostly solid with a thick layer of keratin, the same material as fingernails, hair, and rhino horn.</p>
                  <p class="card-text">The helmeted hornbill’s casque—the <span class='text-red'>horny helmet</span> above its beak— is mostly solid, unlike those of other hornbills. Softer than ivory, it can be finely <span class="text-red">carved into beads, figurines, and artistic scenes.</span> These casques, carved with Chinese
                     designs, were confiscated by law enforcement in the U.S.</p>

Years of widespread poaching and civil war in their

                  <p class="card-text">The commercial <span class='text-red'>trade in bushmeat</span>, which occurs throughout west and central Africa, <span class='text-red'>is today the biggest threat to gorillas.</span> Apes are being killed to primarily to supply high-end demand for meat in urban centers, where the consumption
                     of <span class='text-red'>ape meat is considered to be prestigious amongst the wealthy elite.</span> Estimating numbers of gorillas poached is difficult because they are often butchered and eaten on the spot, or their meat is smoked for later sale in towns.</p>

                  <p class="card-text">These <span class='text-red'>majestic creatures are critically endangered</span> due to the destruction of their habitat by the logging, palm oil and rubber industries in Asia. Over two-thirds of the species’ lowland forest habitat has been razed in the last 25 years
                     and nearly 70 percent of its natural habitat destroyed in just one generation. This has resulted in the animals invading local villages, destroying homes and crops. Forest rangers and activists from the Wildlife Conservation Society
                     are trying various methods to return them to the forest, including training them to keep away and hunting for illegal loggers. There are currently between 2,400 and 2,800 of the mammals left, confined to small patches of forest. <span class='text-red'>Because
                     only male Sumatran elephants have tusks, poaching has drastically skewed the sex ratio of this species, severely threatening breeding rates.</span></p>
